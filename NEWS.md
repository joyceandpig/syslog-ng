<!-- Thu, 19 Apr 2018 10:55:16 +0200 -->

## Features

 * Support added for `if`/`elif`/`else` blocks to the configuration file syntax.
   (#1856)
 * Dramatically improved debug messages during filter/parser evaluation. (#1898)
 * The `hook-commands` module was added, allowing one to run custom commands on
   source or destination setup and teardown. (#1951)
 * Implemented a way to skip processing included config file snippets in case a
   dependency is missing: The `@requires json` pragma. (#827, #1956)
 * Basic client-side failover support was implemented. (#1905)
 * Errors from python destinations are now reported together with any exception
   text (if any). (#1931)

## Bugfixes

 * Fix a crash that happened on disk queue restart. (#1886)
 * Fixed another crash when a corrupted disk queue file was being moved away.
   (#1924)
 * Fixed a value conflict in the `afstreams` module's grammar file.
 * We now link directly to the `evtlog` shipped with syslog-ng, and are not
   using the system library, not even when present. (#1915)
 * TLS destinations now work again without `key-file` or `cert-file` specified.
   (#1916, #1917)
 * SDATA block names are now sanitized, in order to not break the spec when we
   get our SDATA from sources that are more lax (such as JSON). (#1948)
 * Some internal messages contained key-value pairs where the key had spaces in
   it, this has been addressed, they do not contain spaces anymore.
 * Fix compilation on FreeBSD. (#1901)
 * Fix compilation on SLES 11. (#1897)
 * Fix compilation on Hurd. (#1912, #1914)
 * Fix compiltaion on Solaris 10. (#1982, #1983)
 * Fix compilation on MacOS.
 * Various compiler warning-related fixes all over the codebase.

## Other changes

 * POSIX RegExp support was dropped from the filters, PCRE remains available. (#1899)
 * Miscellaneous build-system related fixes and improvements (both autotools and
   CMake).
 * Update `lib/json-c` to `json-c-0.13-20171207`. (#1900)

## Notes to the developers

 * The `init()` function is now optional for Python destinations. (#1756)
 * The Docker environment (`dbld/`) has seen significant changes, among them an
   upgrade to Ubuntu Xenial. (#1876)
 * `dbld/rules` gained two new targets: `login` and `build`, that do what their
   names suggest. (#1927)
 * The `LogPipe` object gained a `pre_init()` and a `post_deinit()` method, used
   by the `hook-commands` module.
